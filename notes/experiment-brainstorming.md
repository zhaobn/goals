* When planning is difficult or impossible for novel goals, demonstrate an efficient model for goal selection when planning is difficult or impossible. 
* When planning is difficult or impossible for novel goals, test what strategies that people use to select goals. 
* Can we describe people's prior biases for goal selection using a grammar without doing handcrafting?
* How do people incorperate transition function or starting state information into these preferences? Planning might be expensive, but might be feasible for a couple of candidate goals. (Giving people the starting state)
* How do people figure out what goals have high utility for them before they are learned? 
* And how might a library be learned such that people can expressively consider what goals they want to pursue?

Experiment 1

* Have goals (sequentially?) chosen without just having transition function information from the environment. 
* Does the order of goal selection actually matter even when they are not traversing the task space? Is that related ot othe rprogram synthesis work?

Experiment 2

* Have people then choose goals being given some information about the transition function.

Experiment 3

* Have people actually need to achieve the goals that they set for themselves and see if that affects their choices (learning progress might have influence for example).

Experiment 4

* People are able to choose goals by actually composing the programs themselves.

Experiment 5

* Have people not know the transition function information, and then slowly learn that information. How does this get incopretaed with goal choices?



Separately, how do people infer signals of goal progress for novel goals? We might hypothesize that people are using some measure of  similarity between percepts. Different perceptual comparisons might lead to different methods for learning, especially if uncertainty is taken into account.
